# Textmining & Classifier build
regulatory text mining & classifier model build

A R Script written as a template to perform text mining for word frequencies on a rule entity level for regulation. The code produces an output that can be used to train machine learning algorithims to classify requirement level text. The initial model was built using a naive bayes classifier and the code is being adjusted now to run support vector machines algorithim instead. The new model will also utilize a much larger raw data set (40K rows of US FEDERAL LAW).
