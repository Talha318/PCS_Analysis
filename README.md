# Textmining & Classifier build
regulatory text mining & classifier model build

A R Script written as a template to perform text mining for word frequencies on a rule entity level for regulation. The code produces an output that can be used to train machine learning algorithims to classify requirement level text. The initial model was built using a naive bayes classifier. A new model will utilize a much larger raw data set (40K rows of US FEDERAL LAW).
